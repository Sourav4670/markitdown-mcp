> [!IMPORTANT]
> MarkItDown performs I/O with the privileges of the current process. Like open() or requests.get(), it will access resources that the process itself can access. Sanitize your inputs in untrusted environments, and call the narrowest `convert_*` function needed for your use case (e.g., `convert_stream()`, or `convert_local()`). See the [Security Considerations](#security-considerations) section of the documentation for more information.

## Overview

This is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** for MarkItDown, a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. The server provides three tools for document conversion through multiple transport modes (Streamable HTTP, SSE, and stdio).

### Supported File Formats

MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from:

- PDF
- PowerPoint
- Word
- Excel
- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)
- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)
- HTML
- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- ZIP files (iterates over contents)
- Youtube URLs
- EPubs
- ... and more!

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still
provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as
OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively "_speak_" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their
responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of
Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions
are also highly token-efficient.

## Prerequisites

MarkItDown MCP Server requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

If using `uv`, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use 'uv pip install' rather than just 'pip install' to install packages in this virtual environment
```

If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with:

```bash
conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown
```

## Installation

To install MarkItDown MCP Server with all optional dependencies, use pip:

```bash
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

Alternatively, you can install it from the source:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd markitdown-tool
pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## MCP Server Usage

### Available Tools

The server provides three tools:

1. **convert_to_markdown** - Convert documents from URIs (http:, https:, file:, data:)
2. **convert_local_file** - Convert local files by absolute/relative path
3. **convert_stream** - Convert content from strings/streams with optional file extension hint

### Transport Modes

#### 1. Streamable HTTP (Recommended)

```bash
# Start server on default port 8000
markitdown-mcp --mode streamable-http --port 8000

# Start on custom port
markitdown-mcp --mode streamable-http --port 3001 --host 127.0.0.1
```

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Response: {"status":"ok"}
```

**Server Info:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
# Response: {"status":"ok","transport":"streamable-http","server":"markitdown-mcp","tools":3}
```

#### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

```bash
markitdown-mcp --mode sse --port 8000
```

#### 3. Standard I/O (stdio)

```bash
markitdown-mcp --mode stdio
```

### Environment Variables

- **MARKITDOWN_ENABLE_PLUGINS** - Enable MarkItDown plugins (true/false, default: false)

## Docker Deployment

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t markitdown-mcp .
```

### Run with Docker

**Default Port (8000):**
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 markitdown-mcp
```

**Custom Port:**
```bash
docker run -e PORT=3001 -p 3001:3001 markitdown-mcp
```

**Enable Plugins:**

```

**Mount Local Directory (for file: URIs):**
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/docs:/workdir -e PORT=8000 -p 8000:8000 markitdown-mcp
```

## MCP Client Configuration

### Claude Desktop (Streamable HTTP)

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "markitdown": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
      "description": "MarkItDown document conversion with 3 tools"
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Client (stdio)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "markitdown": {
      "command": "markitdown-mcp",
      "args": ["--mode", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Command-Line Usage (MarkItDown Library)

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md
```

Or use `-o` to specify the output file:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md
```

You can also pipe content:

```bash
cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown
```

### Optional Dependencies
MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:

```bash
pip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]'
```

will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:

* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies
* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files
* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files
* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files
* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files
* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files
* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages
* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence
* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files
* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription

### Plugins

MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins
```

To enable plugins use:

```bash
markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf
```

To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.

#### markitdown-ocr Plugin

The `markitdown-ocr` plugin adds OCR support to PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX converters, extracting text from embedded images using LLM Vision — the same `llm_client` / `llm_model` pattern that MarkItDown already uses for image descriptions. No new ML libraries or binary dependencies required.

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install markitdown-ocr
pip install openai  # or any OpenAI-compatible client
```

**Usage:**

Pass the same `llm_client` and `llm_model` you would use for image descriptions:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

md = MarkItDown(
    enable_plugins=True,
    llm_client=OpenAI(),
    llm_model="gpt-4o",
)
result = md.convert("document_with_images.pdf")
print(result.text_content)
```

If no `llm_client` is provided the plugin still loads, but OCR is silently skipped and the standard built-in converter is used instead.

See [`packages/markitdown-ocr/README.md`](packages/markitdown-ocr/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Azure Document Intelligence

To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:

```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e "<document_intelligence_endpoint>"
```

More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)

### Python API

Basic usage in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content)
```

Document Intelligence conversion in Python:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint="<document_intelligence_endpoint>")
result = md.convert("test.pdf")
print(result.text_content)
```

To use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model="gpt-4o", llm_prompt="optional custom prompt")
result = md.convert("example.jpg")
print(result.text_content)
```

### Docker

```sh
docker build -t markitdown:latest .
docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md
```

### Running Tests and Checks

- Navigate to the MarkItDown package:

  ```sh
  cd packages/markitdown
  ```

- Install `hatch` in your environment and run tests:

  ```sh
  pip install hatch  # Other ways of installing hatch: https://hatch.pypa.io/dev/install/
  hatch shell
  hatch test
  ```

  (Alternative) Use the Devcontainer which has all the dependencies installed:

  ```sh
  # Reopen the project in Devcontainer and run:
  hatch test
  ```

- Run pre-commit checks before submitting a PR: `pre-commit run --all-files`

### Security Considerations

MarkItDown performs I/O with the privileges of the current process. Like `open()` or `requests.get()`, it will access resources that the process itself can access. 

**Sanitize your inputs:** Do not pass untrusted input directly to MarkItDown. If any part of the input may be controlled by an untrusted user or system, such as in hosted or server-side applications, it must be validated and restricted before calling MarkItDown. Depending on your environment, this may include restricting file paths, limiting URI schemes and network destinations, and blocking access to private, loopback, link-local, or metadata-service addresses. 

**Call only the conversion method you need:** Prefer the narrowest conversion API that fits your use case. MarkItDown's `convert()` method is intentionally permissive and can handle local files, remote URIs, and byte streams. If your application only needs to read local files, call `convert_local()` instead. If you need more control over URI fetching, call `requests.get()` yourself and pass the response object to `convert_response()`. For maximum control, open a stream to the input you want converted and call `convert_stream()`.
